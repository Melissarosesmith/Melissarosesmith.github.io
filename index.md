# Welcome to Melissa Smith's ePortfolio

### Welcome to my ePortfolio! As I stand on the cusp of graduating with a degree in Computer Science, this platform serves as a testament to my journey of exploration, growth, and passion for technology. As I embark on the exciting transition from student to a professional in the field, I invite you to explore my portfolio, where you'll discover my dedication to continuous learning, problem-solving skills, and enthusiasm for contributing to the dynamic landscape of computer science. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

## Introduction
### The original artifact I have chosen to use for all three enhancements is a text-based adventure game implemented in the Python programming language. The project was initially created during one of my first Computer Science courses, IT-140. It was meant to demonstrate my understanding of the Python language and software development principles. Please visit [original code](https://github.com/Melissarosesmith/Melissarosesmith.github.io/blob/338dcd8ae9969d127707e91a975aa6c9e1f3550a/Original%20Code/TextBasedGame-Original.py). The following is a map of the rooms for the text-based adventure game.

## Software Design and Engineering
### As stated in the introduction, the original artifact is a text-based adventure game implemented in the Python programming language. The project was initially created during one of my first Computer Science courses, IT-140. It was meant to demonstrate my understanding of the Python language and software development principles.
### I am including this artifact in my ePortfolio because it effectively showcases my skills in object-oriented programming, algorithm design, and user input handling. The project involved the creation of a complex game structure, requiring the implementation of data structures to manage the game state. The decision-making logic and user interaction components demonstrate my ability to design user-friendly interfaces and handle diverse user inputs. Additionally, the inclusion of advanced features, such as inventory management and room transitions, highlights my problem-solving skills in a challenging programming environment. Overall, this artifact serves as a comprehensive representation of my technical competencies in software development, particularly in C++.
### During the enhancement process, I focused on improving the code structure, adding comments for clarity, and addressing issues such as const-correctness. The initial version had some issues, like trying to modify const objects, which were resolved in the current version. This enhancement aligns with the course objectives related to code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. The artifact designed and evaluated computing solutions to solve problems and managed the trade-offs involved in converting from the Python programming language to the C++ programming language.
### Throughout the process of creating and improving this artifact, I learned the importance of code maintainability and the significance of adhering to coding standards. Challenges included debugging complex logical errors and addressing const-correctness issues. I learned that converting one programming language to another is not as straightforward as it might seem. Python and C++ can be similar in ways, but there are also big differences in each languageâ€™s syntax. The experience reinforced the value of code documentation and the importance of iterative development for continuous improvement.
### **Course Outcome 3:**
### The skills for this artifact design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. The enhancements design a text-based adventure game that involves moving through various rooms, collecting items, and interacting with a zombie. It employs algorithms to handle player movement, item retrieval, and game progression. The moveRooms function defines the algorithm for determining the next room based on the current room and the player's move. This is an essential part of the game's logic, demonstrating the application of algorithmic principles. Standard C++ constructs are used, such as vectors, maps, loops, conditional statements, and string manipulation, aligning with common practices in C++ programming. The enhancements efficiently manage the trade-offs involved in processing user input for item retrieval and movement. It uses conditional statements to validate inputs, handles different cases, and provides appropriate feedback to the player, demonstrating careful consideration of design choices.
### **Course Outcome 2:**
### The skills for this artifact design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. The enhancements include clear and informative comments that describe the purpose and functionality of different sections. This contributes to the code's readability and helps other developers understand the design choices and implementation details. The enhancements include user-friendly messages that explain the game's objectives, rules, and player interactions. This adaptation is crucial for players who may not be familiar with the underlying code but need clear instructions to play the game effectively. The comments and output messages are designed to communicate effectively with both developers (for understanding the code) and players (for understanding the game).
