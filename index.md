### Throughout the process of creating and improving this artifact, I learned the importance of code maintainability and the significance of adhering to coding standards. Challenges included debugging complex logical errors and addressing const-correctness issues. I learned that converting one programming language to another is not as straightforward as it might seem. Python and C++ can be similar in ways, but there are also big differences in each language’s syntax. The experience reinforced the value of code documentation and the importance of iterative development for continuous improvement.
### **Course Outcome 2:**
### **The skills for this artifact design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.** The enhancements include clear and informative comments that describe the purpose and functionality of different sections. This contributes to the code's readability and helps other developers understand the design choices and implementation details. The enhancements include user-friendly messages that explain the game's objectives, rules, and player interactions. This adaptation is crucial for players who may not be familiar with the underlying code but need clear instructions to play the game effectively. The comments and output messages are designed to communicate effectively with both developers (for understanding the code) and players (for understanding the game).
### **Course Outcome 3:**
### **The skills for this artifact design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.** The enhancements design a text-based adventure game that involves moving through various rooms, collecting items, and interacting with a zombie. It employs algorithms to handle player movement, item retrieval, and game progression. The moveRooms function defines the algorithm for determining the next room based on the current room and the player's move. This is an essential part of the game's logic, demonstrating the application of algorithmic principles. Standard C++ constructs are used, such as vectors, maps, loops, conditional statements, and string manipulation, aligning with common practices in C++ programming. The enhancements efficiently manage the trade-offs involved in processing user input for item retrieval and movement. It uses conditional statements to validate inputs, handles different cases, and provides appropriate feedback to the player, demonstrating careful consideration of design choices.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
### As stated in the introduction, the original artifact is a text-based adventure game implemented in the Python programming language. The project was initially created during one of my first Computer Science courses, IT-140. It was meant to demonstrate my understanding of the Python language and software development principles.
### I selected this artifact because I saw the potential it had to be improved. The artifact showcases skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures. The representation of the game world as a dictionary with rooms as nodes and directions as edges demonstrates an understanding of graph-based structures. The move_rooms function efficiently checks for valid moves in the current room, showcasing knowledge of graph traversal. The use of the inventory list to keep track of collected items demonstrates proficiency in using data structures to manage and track in-game resources. Effective use of conditional statements in various parts of the code showcases logical and algorithmic thinking. The code abstracts the game's state and logic into functions, providing a clean separation between different aspects of the game, contributing to better maintainability and readability. Overall, the artifact combines these components to create an interactive text-based game that leverages algorithms and data structures to manage the game world, player inventory, and user interactions effectively.
### The enhancements for the text-based game artifact optimize the game loop to prevent unnecessary checks or redundant code execution. It does this by checking the room for a zombie only when necessary and optimizing command parsing. The choice of different data structures, like the inventory list and the dictionary, impacts the time complexity of various operations within the game. These include the item retrieval, inventory checks, and room traversal. Maintaining low time complexity ensures scalability. The algorithmic logic was improved by ensuring that command processing is clearer and more concise. The game’s state transitions are well defined and unambiguous. Adding the new functions and refactoring the existing functions created a more efficient and overall, better performing program.
### The enhanced code optimizes algorithmic logic and efficiency by reducing redundancy and improving code readability. Specifically, the ‘show_status’ function eliminates repetitive code blocks for each room by using a common structure for item handling. This reduces code duplication and makes the function more concise. The improved function introduces a separate function ‘get_item_input’ to handle the logic for getting an item. This promotes modularization and improves code readability. It also allows for easy modification or extension of item-related logic. The ‘get_item_input” function also showcases the time complexity of the algorithmic logic. It does this by validating the user input and only checking the first split elements, which is an O(1) time complexity operation.
```
if command == 'get' and len(args) == 1 and args[0] == item.lower():
   inventory.append(item)
   print(f'{item.title()} retrieved')
else:
   print('Invalid input')
```
### Overall, from modifying this artifact I have learned that there are many ways to implement logic into code. When I originally created the text-based game, my only worries were making sure the code worked, now I’ve been able to improve that code so it functions and looks much better. I learned that just because the code works, doesn’t mean it can’t be improved.
### **Course Outcome 4:**
### **The skills for this artifact demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.** The enhancements use well-founded techniques such as input validation, dictionary-based room/item management, and efficient checks for game progression. It employs common Python programming tools and techniques to implement the game logic effectively. The code provides value by implementing a functional text-based adventure game with clear instructions, item retrieval mechanics, and game progression logic. It aligns with the industry-specific goal of creating engaging and interactive software solutions. The code optimizes algorithmic logic and demonstrates efficiency in several aspects:
* It utilizes a dictionary structure for rooms, providing O(1) access for room and item data, optimizing room navigation and item retrieval logic.
* Input handling and validation, such as normalizing user input to lowercase and stripping whitespace, contribute to robust computing practices.
* The use of O(1) operations for key checks in dictionaries and length checks in the inventory contributes to the efficiency of the code.
### **Course Outcome 5:**
### **The skills for this artifact develops a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.** The enhancements implement input validation to ensure that users can't exploit the game by providing invalid input. This aligns with the goal of ensuring the security of the game's logic and preventing unintended behaviors. It shows a general awareness of user input validation in the ‘get_item_input’ and ‘move_rooms’ functions, preventing potential exploits through validation checks. This aligns with the development of a security mindset.
