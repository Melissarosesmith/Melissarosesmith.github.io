# Welcome to Melissa Smith's ePortfolio

### Welcome to my ePortfolio! As I stand on the cusp of graduating with a degree in Computer Science, this platform serves as a testament to my journey of exploration, growth, and passion for technology. As I embark on the exciting transition from student to a professional in the field, I invite you to explore my portfolio, where you'll discover my dedication to continuous learning, problem-solving skills, and enthusiasm for contributing to the dynamic landscape of computer science. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

## Introduction
### The artifact I have chosen for each enhancement is a text-based adventure game implemented in the Python programming language. The project was initially created during one of my first Computer Science courses, IT-140. It was meant to demonstrate my understanding of the Python language and software development principles. Please visit [original code](https://github.com/Melissarosesmith/Melissarosesmith.github.io/blob/338dcd8ae9969d127707e91a975aa6c9e1f3550a/Original%20Code/TextBasedGame-Original.py). The following is a map of the rooms for the text-based adventure game.
