### The enhanced code optimizes algorithmic logic and efficiency by reducing redundancy and improving code readability. Specifically, the ‘show_status’ function eliminates repetitive code blocks for each room by using a common structure for item handling. This reduces code duplication and makes the function more concise. The improved function introduces a separate function ‘get_item_input’ to handle the logic for getting an item. This promotes modularization and improves code readability. It also allows for easy modification or extension of item-related logic. The ‘get_item_input” function also showcases the time complexity of the algorithmic logic. It does this by validating the user input and only checking the first split elements, which is an O(1) time complexity operation.
```
if command == 'get' and len(args) == 1 and args[0] == item.lower():
   inventory.append(item)
   print(f'{item.title()} retrieved')
else:
   print('Invalid input')
```
### Overall, from modifying this artifact I have learned that there are many ways to implement logic into code. When I originally created the text-based game, my only worries were making sure the code worked, now I’ve been able to improve that code so it functions and looks much better. I learned that just because the code works, doesn’t mean it can’t be improved.
